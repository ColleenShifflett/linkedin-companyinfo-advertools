Add company info to a LinkedIn campaign company report.

From my original LinkedIn post:

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥How to use Advertools to pull more information about companies from your LinkedIn campaign company reports into Google Sheets to check for necessary exclusionsðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Thank you Cody West for sharing this use case over the weekend! If you're not already following him, do so now, and check out what he's shared regarding his LinkedIn campaign exclusion list process.

In his posts he mentioned possibilities for further automation, and that's why I'm sharing this today.

To give you some context the output I'm going for is a quick, automated one-look report that pulls in each top company's LinkedIn company page information to quickly scan for possible additions to an exclusion list for a given campaign.

Creating an exclusion list can help you reduce wasted spend from targeting ads at people who work at companies that don't fit you ideal customer profile.

I'm essentially turning a list of top companies being served ads into a search query, which then runs and returns the company's LinkedIn profile link and description from their company page. This can then either be analyzed from a CSV file, or pulled directly into a Google Sheet, and then added to your exclusion list record as apppropriate.

Why Advertools?

Advertools is an open source Python library that covers use cases in online marketing, SEO, SEM, crawling, text analysis, and more.

I've just started to experiment with this lately thanks to Pasha Irshad sharing the documentation.

Familiarizing myself with Python, R, and SQL has been an important part of my journey as a marketer because we often deal with so many repetitive reports and analyses that take a long time because we're limited by the way we can capture data in each platform.

It's been a long journey, and I still have a ways to go, but I'm enjoying applying new skills to marketing use cases.

By the way, this is my first ever LinkedIn video post! It took me WAY too many takes, and please forgive my clunkiness as I paused and changed screens to protect information. Video editing is not my strong suit!

Would you like example Python scripts from the ones that I used so you can try this out on your own?

Let me know and I'd be glad to share!

What more can be done with this process? What other use cases do you think could benefit marketers?
